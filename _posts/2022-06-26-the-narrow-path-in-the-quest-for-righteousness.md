>“A person wants to become a scholar and a leader overnight, and to sleep that night as well.”  
> –Rabbi Yaizel of Navorodock

This quote is simple yet profound and applicable to many areas of life. Becoming a righteous husband, wife, 
parent, teacher, leader, business owner, or steward requires diligence and self-discipline. It’s hard!
It can take decades. The need for such vigilance is something that few of us wish to acknowledge. Are you up for 
the challenge?

It requires taking the narrow path. A path which the majority scoffs at and ridicules. You may not see the fruits of 
your labor for years. You may start comparing yourself to those who took the "easy" path, and you might wonder,
“Is it worth it?” The truth is, the "easy" path is the "hard" path, but perseverance and discipline yields a bountiful
harvest.

>"For the moment, all discipline seems not to be pleasant, but painful; yet to those who have been trained by it, 
afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness." (Hebrews 12:11, NASB)

What you are doing now is building a firm foundation. A foundation that will stand the test of time. Not just for this 
generation, but for the generations to come. When the storms come - and they will come - and when the wolf comes 
knocking at your door, you will be like the man who built his house on the rock and the third pig who built his house 
of brick. You will overcome. You will survive, and you will prosper.

So, be encouraged you happy warriors. Continue building, cultivating, warring and transforming yourselves, your 
families, your neighborhoods, your workplaces, and all those around you. **In an age of unrighteousness, strive to be 
righteous.** Little by little. Day by day. Year by year. Decade by decade. Generation by generation - until the kingdom 
comes.
